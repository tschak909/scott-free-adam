# scott-free-adam

This is a version of scottfreeZX, in itself a version of the scottfree interpreter, which has been adapted to run on the Coleco Adam. It can be built with Z88DK.

The LICENSE.md file applies to the scottfreeZX interpreter, and the license for the games is in the games/ directory.

## Note about building

You can build with the Makefile.generic makefile to produce a CP/M binary that expects an 80 column terminal, and does not have the ADAM console extensions.
